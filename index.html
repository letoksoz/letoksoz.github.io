      <h2 class="project-tagline"><!--Welcome to my website, my name is Levent Toksoz.--> <br> I graduated from University of Michigan-Ann Arbor this April with a double major in honors physics and pure math. I  wrote my Honors Thesis on 21-cm cosmology. I am really interested in combining computer science techniques with other fields. Currently, I am working on two machine learning projects.

<h3 id="NeuroD2-project" class="currentproject-tagline" ><b>NeuroD2 Project: </b></h3>

<p>The aim of this project is to identify and characterize binding sites of NeuroD2 protein on DNA using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, which will enable us to understand the functional role of NeuroD2 protein in neuronal differentiation. The data was obtained by combining several different data sets such as ChIP-Seq Data and Histone Binding Data. Preprocessing the data was one of crucial and challenging parts of this project,since the data was too large and sparse. Special mini batching technique called oversampling is employed to obtain a balanced data sets(about equal number of positve and negative samples). The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/letoksoz/NeuroD2Machine-Learning">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have been using Julia and Knet package to implement machine learning algorithms.<a href="https://github.com/letoksoz/NeuroD2Machine-Learning"> Here</a> is a sample log regression algorithm I wrote in Julia using Knet package.(Ml.jl file)</p>

<h3 id="Accounting-project" class="currentproject-tagline" ><b>Accounting Paper Project: </b></h3>

<p><b>Title:</b><i> "Machine Learning and Financial Distress Prediction"</i></p>
<p>Our aim is to identify factors correlating with financial distress of the firms listed on the Borsa Istanbul Stock exchange using Machine learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression,Neural Networks,Beehive algorithm and random forests,which will enable us to develop a model to investigate the effect of financial ratios on the likelihood of financial distress. We have been implementing machine learning algorithms using Python. The repository is not available for public use. Our short term goal is  to submit this paper to conferences in order to get feedback for the findings before submitting it to a journal.<a href="https://github.com/letoksoz/NeuroD2Machine-Learning"> Here</a> is the abstract of our paper.</p>

<h2 id="Honors-thesis" class="main-content-tagline" ><b>Honors Thesis: </b></h2>
<p><b>Title:</b><i> "21 cm Hydrogen Line and Its Power Spectrum"</i></p>
<p><b>Advisor:</b> Professor Dragan Huterer(University of Michigan Ann Arbor Department of Physics)</p>

<p>In this thesis, I examined 21 cm Hydrogen Line and utilized statistical techniques,such as Fisher Matrix,to forecast the precision of cosmological parameters inherent to the model in the presence of noise,using Python and CAMB sources. You can find my Honors Thesis <a href="https://letoksoz.github.io/21-cm%20Cosmology.pdf">here</a>.</p>
