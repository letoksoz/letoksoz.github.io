<h3 id="NeuroD2-project" class="currentproject-tagline" ><b>NeuroD2 Project: </b></h3>

<p>The aim of this project is to identify and characterize binding sites of NeuroD2 protein on DNA using machine learning algorithms
  such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, which will enable us to understand the functional role
  of NeuroD2 protein in neuronal differentiation. These algorithms are implemented using Julia and Knet package.
  The data was obtained by combining several different data sets such as ChIP-Seq Data and Histone Binding Data.
  Different bioinformatic techniques are used to model position of a NeuroD2 protein within DNA. Also we implement window architecture ,which uses a similar logic as RNN does, to our machine learning models to represent the relationship between NeuroD2 protein and its interacting partners.The effect of window architecture in one of our models can be seen in the following graph. </p>

<p><b>Title:</b><i> "Machine Learning and Financial Distress Prediction"</i></p>
<p>Our aim is to identify factors correlating with financial distress of the firms listed on the Borsa Istanbul Stock exchange using Machine learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Beehive algorithm and random forests, which will enable us to develop a model to investigate the effect of financial ratios on the likelihood of financial distress. We have been implementing machine learning algorithms using Python. The repository is not available for public use. Our short term goal is to submit this paper to conferences in order to get feedback for the findings before submitting it to a journal.</p>

<p><b>Title:</b><i> "21 cm Hydrogen Line and Its Power Spectrum"</i></p>
<p><b>Advisor:</b> Professor Dragan Huterer (University of Michigan Ann Arbor Department of Physics)</p>

<p>In this thesis, I examined 21 cm Hydrogen Line and utilized statistical techniques,such as Fisher Matrix,to forecast the precision of cosmological parameters inherent to the model in the presence of noise,using Python and CAMB sources. </p>
