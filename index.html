<h3 id="NeuroD2-project" class="currentproject-tagline" ><b>NeuroD2 Project: </b></h3>

<p>The aim of this project is to identify and characterize NeuroD2 protein&nbsp;binding sites on DNA using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, neural networks and convolutional neural networks, which will enable us to better understand the functional role of NeuroD2 protein in neuronal differentiation. These algorithms are implemented using the&nbsp;Knet package in Julia. Data is obtained by combining several different datasets, including ChIP-Seq Data and Histone Binding Data. Different bioinformatic techniques are used to model&nbsp;the position of a NeuroD2 protein within DNA. Also, we implement window architecture, which uses a similar logic to RNN, to our machine learning models to represent the relationship between NeuroD2 protein and its interacting partners. The effect of this window architecture in one of our models can be seen in the following graph. </p>

<p><b>Title:</b><i> "Machine Learning and Financial Distress Prediction"</i></p>
<p>The aim of this project is to identify factors correlating with financial distress for the firms listed on the Borsa Istanbul Stock Exchange using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, neural networks, beehive algorithm and random forests, which will enable us to develop a model to investigate the effect of certain financial ratios on the likelihood of financial distress. We have been implementing machine learning algorithms using Python. The repository is not yet available for public use. The short-term goal is to submit this paper to conferences in order to get feedback on the findings before ultimately submitting it to a journal.</p>

<p><b>Title:</b><i> "21 cm Hydrogen Line and Its Power Spectrum"</i></p>
<p><b>Advisor:</b> Professor Dragan Huterer (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Department of Physics)</p>

<p>In this thesis, I examined the 21 cm Hydrogen Line and utilized statistical techniques, such as the Fisher Matrix, to forecast the precision of cosmological parameters inherent to the model in the presence of noise, using Python and CAMB sources.</p>
